Hello there! I am Qian Zhang (张慊), a fourth year Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics at Brown University. My thesis advisor is George Em Karniadakis.

My research interests are AI for science and neuromorphic computation for scientific machine learning. Currenty, I am working on the application of large language models (LLMs) in high-dimensional optimal control and operator learning for reconstruction problems.

Prior to my study at Brown University, I obtained B.S. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science, Peking University in 2020. I worked with Shaoqiang Tang on the numerical boundary treatment for differential equations.
